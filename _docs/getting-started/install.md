We assume that you already have Git installed on your machine. Run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/linagora/hublin.git && cd hublin
```

Install the right version of Node.js (lts/carbon v8.9.4). We encourage to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and so install and switch to the right version with:

``` sh
nvm use
```

Then install all the required dependencies

``` sh
npm install
```

Once [configured]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /getting-started/configuration.md %}), and all services are up i.e. MongoDB, Redis, Janus (optional based on your requirements), you can start Hublin with

``` sh
npm start

# or

node server.js
```
